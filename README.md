### üìù Take Note

1. I find it tricky to keep the name in package.json and PROJECT_NAME in .env in sync. So whenever you change one, make sure to update the other two. Of course, I'm thinking of using a script to get this done.

2. some variables need to be set:

  - .env.server

  |     name      |     description     |      example      |
  | :-----------: | :-----------------: | :---------------: |
  |   SMTP_HOST   |   email smtp host   | smtpdm.aliyun.com |
  |   SMTP_PORT   |   email smtp port   |        25         |
  |   SMTP_USER   | email smtp username |    xxx@xxx.com    |
  | SMTP_PASSWORD | email smtp password |       xxxx        |
  |  JWT_SECRET   |     jwt secret      |     a string      |

## client

The server-side currently consists of Vue and Vite.
