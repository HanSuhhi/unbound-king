### üìù Take Note

1. I find it tricky to keep the name in package.json and PROJECT_NAME in .env in sync. So whenever you change one, make sure to update the other two. Of course, I'm thinking of using a script to get this done.

2. some variables need to be set:

  Here, I have utilized Ali‚Äôs email campaign service and OSS object storage service.

  - .env.server

  |     name      |     description     |      example      |
  | :-----------: | :-----------------: | :---------------: |
  |   SMTP_HOST   |   email smtp host   | smtpdm.aliyun.com |
  |   SMTP_PORT   |   email smtp port   |        25         |
  |   SMTP_USER   | email smtp username |    xxx@xxx.com    |
  | SMTP_PASSWORD | email smtp password |       xxxx        |
  |  JWT_SECRET   |     jwt secret      |     a string      |
  <!--
  |  OSS_REGION   |   ali oss region    |   [ali-oss region](https://github.com/ali-sdk/ali-oss#node-usage)    |
  |    OSS_KEY    |   ali oss key id    |  [ali-oss user key](https://github.com/ali-sdk/ali-oss#node-usage)   |
  |  OSS_SECRET   |   ali oss secret    | [ali-oss user secret](https://github.com/ali-sdk/ali-oss#node-usage) |
  |  OSS_BUCKET   | ali oss bucket name |   [ali-oss bucket](https://github.com/ali-sdk/ali-oss#node-usage)    |
  -->

3. To save Git space, I have hidden most of the image resources. If you need access to these resources, please contact me at l_98b@outlook.com.
