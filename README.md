### üìù Take Note

1. For database connectivity, this project relies on [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) with x509. Just so you know, you may need to get a PEM at some point and dump it under server/certs. Once you have it, tweak KEY_NAME in app.module.ts.

2. I find it tricky to keep the name in package.json and PROJECT_NAME in .env in sync. So whenever you change one, make sure to update the other two. Of course, I'm thinking of using a script to get this done.

3. some variables need to be set:

  - .env.server

  |     name      |     description     |      example      |
  | :-----------: | :-----------------: | :---------------: |
  |   SMTP_HOST   |   email smtp host   | smtpdm.aliyun.com |
  |   SMTP_PORT   |   email smtp port   |        25         |
  |   SMTP_USER   | email smtp username |    xxx@xxx.com    |
  | SMTP_PASSWORD | email smtp password |       xxxx        |

## client

The server-side currently consists of Vue and Vite.
